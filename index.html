# Introduction to Version Control with Git

# What is Version Control?

A system for managing changes to a codebase.

---

#What is Git?

* One of many Version Control Systems out there.
* Others include Mercurial, Subversion, CVS
* Distributed Version Control vs Client Server

* Determining how and when code changed
* Access to previous versions of code
* Multiple people editing the same code at the same time

---
layout: false

# How does it do this?
* Store changes in a 'repository'
* Give each change (called a 'commit') a unique identifier. 
* Allow labelling and access to each of these commits
* Allow sharing of the repository and commits

---
# Installing Git
http://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git

---
#Initializing a repository
```bash
mkdir myapp
cd myapp
git init
```

---
# Viewing status

```bash
git status
```
* Lists all changes staged for commit
* Lists all files that are different from the staging area
* Lists any files that haven't been added to the repository

---
#Creating a commit

Add the file to the staging area (index)
```bash
git add <filename>
```
Create a commit with all changes in the staging area
```bash
git commit -m "First commit" 
```

---
# Viewing history

```bash
git log
```

---
# Viewing commits

```bash
git show <sha>
```

---
#Referencing commits
* By sha
```bash
git show 882993b1e3921d33a989795b9c190195f525c569
```
* by short sha
```bash
git show 882993b
```
* Relative to HEAD
```bash
git show HEAD~1
```
* Branch name
```bash
git show <branch name>
```
* Tag name
```bash
git show <tag name>
```

---
# Branches and Tags
Branches and Tags are both pointers to git commits

Branches typically move frequently where tags are usually fixed

---

#Branches
Typically used to separate streams of work
```bash
git branch # Lists all branches in the repository
git branch <branch name> # create a new branch with the given name 
git checkout <branch name> #Moves the HEAD pointer to the specified branch
```

---
#Tags
Typically used for marking releases
```bash
# Lists all tags in the repository
git tag 

# Create a tag with the given name pointing to HEAD. 
# The tag DOES NOT move when more commits are created
git tag <tag name> 

# Creates a tag with the given name pointing to the specified commit
git tag <tag name> <sha> 
```

---
#Visualizations of commits
https://github.com/onlywei/explain-git-with-d3
---

#Diffing commits
* diff between current code and last commit
```bash
git diff
```
* diff specific version
```bash
git diff <sha>
```
* diff tool can be configured in your local .gitconfig

---
# Configuration
```bash
git config <config name> <value>
```

## Global configuration 
~/.gitconfig

```bash
git config --global --edit #edit the global config file
```

## Project specific configuration 
<project root>/.git/config

---
# Ignoring files
Add patterns to the git ignore file to have git ignore the files altogether
<project root>/.gitignore

```bash
git ignore <pattern> #adds the pattern for you
git config --global core.excludesfile ~/.gitignore_global #sets the global ignore file
```

---
#Remote repositories
* Your commits are stored in your repository
* A remote repository is a copy of the entire repository stored elsewhere.
* You share your commits with others by 'pushing' your commits to the remote repository
* You get other people's commits, by 'fetching' commits from a remote repository

---
# Cloning a remote repository
```bash
git clone <url to git repo>
```
* Copy of the entire repository is created on your local machine
* A remote repository is automatically configured.  It is named 'origin'

```bash 
git remote -v #list all remote repositories
```

---
# Remote branches
* Branch pointers are also set on the remote repository
* They will not be changed unless you specifically 'push' that branch.
* You can create or modify branches locally without impacting the remote repository.
```bash
#List all branches, including those in the remote repository
git branch -a 
# Create a local branch pointing at the same location as the remote branch
git checkout <remote branch name> 
```

---
# Getting changes from remote branches
Update your remote branch pointer
```bash
git fetch <repository> <branch>
```
Add the changes from the remote branch to your local branch
```bash
git merge <branch>
```

---
# Fast forward vs merge
When you don't have any changes that aren't in the branch to be merged, git can just move the pointer

Otherwise, git must create a merge commit

---
# Rebasing
Rebasing allows you to avoid merge commits.
```bash
git rebase <branch>
```

---
# Merge conflicts
* When git can't figure out how to merge two sets of changes, you will get a merge conflict.
* In order to resolve this, you will have to manually decide how to resolve the conflicting changes.

---
# Github

---
# Forking
* Copies another repository on github to your own local copy
* Allows you to push changes to a remote repository of your own without affecting the main project

---
# Pull Requests
* Ask the project admin to merge changes from one branch to another.  The changes can (and often are) on different forks
* Allows other developers to review and comment on proposed changes
